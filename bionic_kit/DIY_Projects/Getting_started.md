# *Documentation*
The Getting_started document gives you an overview of the scenarios for the bionics kit. You get information about how it is structured. Also you can find background information on the material and basic programming in Arduino IDE, like code structure, comments and different functions.
There are 3 scenarios for each animal, which are matched to 3 different difficulty levels. Here is an overview:

Level		| Chameleon		| Elephant					| Fish		
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------

## Background information on the material

* **ESP32 :**
<br>The ESP 32 is a microcontroller. A microcontroller is an integrated circuit that brings together 4 essential elements: a processor, memory and peripheral units and input-
output interfaces.
<br>This microcontroller is programmable: with your computer you will be able to control the inputs and outputs and interact with the outside world.

* **Breadboard:**
<br>A breaboard is a board that allows you to connect all of your elements without soldering.
<br>For this, different locations are connected together. The basic structure consists of two rails as illustrated below: Component rails (1) and Power rails (2) with two terminals. One negative terminal marked blue or black and one positive terminal marked red.

## Base of programming with Arduino IDE 
The Arduino IDE tool is an integrated development environment and the interface allows you to import code into the EPS32 microcontroller.

## Global initialisation
Here, the basic structure of the code: 

```
//global variables
//defined throughout the code

//setup() function
{
	//put your setup code here to run once;
}
	//void() function
void loop()
{
	//put your main code here to run repeatedly;
}
``` 

### Variables
A variable is the name for a space in the memory of the microcontroller. There are several types of variables: 

Type | Function | Example
------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
*int* | For storage of whole numbers | *int* number_player = 5;
*float*| For storage of floating | *float* PI_value = 3.14;
 
<br>There are other data e.g. for text. 
<br>
<br>Global variables are variables that are defined outside of functions and can be used throughout the code.
<br>Other variables can be defined in function, but this variable can be used only in the function. After the function has been executed, the variable is deleted. 
<br>*Example:*

```
//define global variable
int c = 0;
//define function addition()
void addition()
{
	//define local variable a and b
	int a=2;
	int b=3;
	//mathematical operation
	c=a+b;
}
```

### Functions
The code can be spread down into several functions. 
<br>The code has two main functions: 
* *setup()*: the code written in this function will only be executed once.
* *loop()*: the code written in this function will be executed repeatedly as long as the ESP32 is powered.

The *setup()* and *loop()* functions are obligatory for the proper functioning of the code. However, other functions can be created. These functions can be called later in 
the two main functions.

```
void name_function()
{
	//instructions of the function
}
void setup()
{
	//put your setup code here to run once;
name_function();
}
void loop()
{
	//put your main code here to run repeatedly;
}
```

### Comments 
The microcontroller executes the instructions from top to bottom. It is possible to add comments in order to make the code more readable. These comments will not be read by the microcontroller. There are two ways to add comments:
* //comment
* /*comment*/

## Tools used functions
### Operation 
Operators are used to apply logical operations to variables.
Symbol | Meaning
------------ | -------------
+| addition
/| division

*Example:*
```
int result=0;
void operation()
{
	int a=10;
	int b=6;
	result=(a+b)/2;
}
```

<br>After executing the *operation()* function, the variable *result* is equal to 8.

### Condition 
* if loop 
<br>The structure of the conditions makes it possible to initiate different instructions according to different conditions. As mentioned earlier, the comparison returns true or 
false. This result is used for the if structure.
If the condition is true the instructions are executed, otherwise the following condition is tested. If none of these conditions is true, we execute the instructions of *else*.

```
if condition_1
{
	//instruction_1
}
else if condition_2
{
	//instruction_2
}
else if condition_3
{
	//instruction_3
}
else
{
	//instruction_4
}
```

* Logical connectors  
A comparison returns a boolean, that is either true or false. For example, 5 > 3 returns true and 5 < 3 returns false. There are several comparators:

Symbol | Meaning
------------ | -------------
< 	| lower
<=	| lower or equal
\> 	| superior
\>= | superior or equal
== 	| equal
!= 	| different 

A condition can be made up of several comparisons, thanks to the logical connectors:
Symbol | Meaning
------------ | -------------
&& 				| and
&#124; &#124; 	| or

*Example:*

```
int a=1;
if((a>=2)&&(a<5))
{
 //instruction_1
}
else
{
 //instruction_2
}
```

<br>Here, *a* is not between 2 and 5. Thus, instructions 2 will be executed.

### For loop 
The For loop makes it possible to carry out a defined number of times of instructions.

```
for (int i=0; i<a; i=i+1)
{
 //instruction
}
```

<br>A variable i is initialized to 0. The latter will be incremented by 1 each time it passes through the loop and the instructions inside the loop are executed. When the variable reaches the value of a, we exit the for loop and the rest of the code is executed.

*Example:*

```
int sum=0;
for (int i=0; i<5; i=i+1)
{
 sum=sum+iM
}
```

<br>Here, we add: 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4. So, after the loop, the variable sum is equal to 10.

### While loop
The while loop is used to execute the instructions as long as the condition is true. So, first of all, we check the condition. If it is true, we execute the instructions. 
Otherwise, we skip the loop.

```
while (condition)
{
 //instruction
}
```

### Do-While loop
The do-while loop is used to execute the instructions as long as the condition is true. Unlike the while loop, we execute the instructions for the first time and then check that 
the condition is true to execute the instructions again.

```
do
{
	//instruction
}
while (condition);
```

## Predefined functions
* **pinMode**(*number_GPIO*,*mode*);
<br>Used to indicate whether the GPIO is defined as: 
<br>-> output mode: *OUTPUT* (ESP32 send information) 
<br>-> input mode: *INPUT* (ESP32 receives information)
* **delay**(*duration*);
<br>Allows you to enter a time delay with *duration* in ms.
* **digitalWrite**(*number_GPIO*,*level*);
<br>Used to power the GPIO in the high state: *HIGH*, otherwise the GPIO is in the low state: *LOW*.
* **Serial.println**("*text*");
<br>Display text on the serial monitor.
<br>You find more predefined function int the ESP32 documentation online.

### Control a servomotor
- **Servo name_servo;** 
<br>Creation of the servo object under the name *name_servo*.
- **name_servo.attach(PIN_SERVO);**
<br>Association between the servo object and the associated pin.
- **servo.write(Angle);**
<br>Control the servomotor, it will move to reach the requested position : Angle (°).

## Compile you code 
<br>This tab allows you to check and upload the code to the microcontroller.
<br>![upload](/bionic_kit/DIY_Projects/Image/uploaded_Arduino_ide.PNG)
<br>This tab opens the serial monitor. It allows you to "communicate" with the ESP32 and to display a text or a variable.
<br>![monitor_serial](/bionic_kit/DIY_Projects/Image/serial_monitor.PNG)
<br>Once the code has been verified and uploaded, if everything has worked, the following message should appear:
