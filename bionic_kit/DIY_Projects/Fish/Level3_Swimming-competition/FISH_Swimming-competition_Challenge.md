```

<br> Lastly, you will definie two variable for the storage of points.

```
//Touch sensor
//Touch variable stores the score, randomly definied by the Touch_point()function
//when the touch sensor is a low level
int Touch;
//Touch variable stores the score, randomly definied by the Touch_point() function
//when the touch sensor is a low level
int Not_Touch;
```

2.*function*

<br> Please use the random function.

```
//0 or 1
int a = random(2);
```

* If *a* is equal to 0, *Touch* is equal to 0 points and *Not_Touch* is equal to 1 point.
* If not, *Touch* is equal to 1 points and *Not_Touch* is equal to 0 point.

GND | GND

## Code: 
1. *global variables* 
<br>Please indicate the numbers of the new GPIO used for the OUT pin of luminosity sensor. In addition, please create a global variable that will stock the value of the limit of the amount of light between day and night. I'd advise you to put the value of 200.
<br><img src="../../Image/bulb_sghr.PNG" alt="bulb" width="50"/> *This value can be modified deponds on the room's light.*
<br>In addition, please define two variable for the storage of points for the light sensor.

```
//Night variable stores the score, randomly defined by the Luminosity_Poit() function
//when the luminosity value is lower than the Luminosity_Limit
int Night;
//Day variable stores the score, randomly defined by the Luminosity_Poit() function
//when the luminosity value is superior or equal than the Luminosity_Limit
int Day;
```

2. *function*
<br>Please complete the Light_Point() function. This function randomly assigns the points for Day and Night variable.
* If *a* is equal to 0, *Day* is equal to 0 points and *Night* is equal to 1 point.
* If not, *Day* is equal to 1 points and *Night* is equal to 0 point.
<br><img src="../../Image/bulb_sghr.PNG" alt="bulb" width="50"/> *Don't hesitate to observe the Touch_Point() function.*
3. *setup()*
<br>Please indicate the mode of new GPIO used. 
<br><img src="../../Image/Warning_sghr.PNG" alt="warning" width="50"/> *The ESP32 receives information from the OUT pin.*
3. *loop()* 
<br>Please call the Light_Point() function and read the data from the luminosity sensor on the OUT pin and display on the serial monitor.

```
//Reading luminosity 
int Luminosity_Value = analogRead(PIN_LIGHT); 
Serial.println("Light");
Serial.println(Luminosity_Value,DEC);
```

<br>The value of the variable will be compared to the limit between day and night defined before. If the value is superior than or equal to the limit,You add the points of the 
day to the score. Otherwise, you add the points of the night to the score.

## Code: 
1. *global variables* 
<br>Please indicate the numbers of the new GPIO used for color sensor.
<br> Then, you will definie three variables for the storage of points for the color sensor.

```
// Blue variable stores the score, randomly defined by the Color_Point() function
// when the color is blue
int Blue;
// Green variable stores the score, randomly defined by the Color_Point() function
// when the color is green
int Green;
// Red variable stores the score, randomly defined by the Color_Point() function
// when the color is red
int Red;
```

2. *function*
<br>Please uncomment the Color_Point() function. This function allows to randomly assigns the points for the Blue,Green and Red values. The table *Table_Point_Color* define the values which can be assigned for the color. If you want to change the color setting, change the values in the table.
2. *setup()*
<br> Please indicate the mode of OUT pin.
<br><img src="../../Image/Warning_sghr.PNG" alt="warning" width="50"/> *The ESP32 receives information from the color sensor.*
3. *loop()*

<br>Please read the data from the color sensor.

```
//Reading color value
int Current_Frequency = pulseIn(PIN_COLOR, HIGH); 
Serial.println("Current_Frequency");
Serial.println(Current_Frequency);
```

<br>The value of the variable will be compared to the frequency values.
* If the value is the color value is equal to the Blue_Frequency value, you add the points of Blue to the score.
* If the value is the color value is equal to the Green_Frequency value, you add the points of Green to the score.
* If the value is the color value is equal to the Red_Frequency value, you add the points of Red to the score.

<br>![Cycle of the day step 2 ](../../Image/Swimming_competition_Structure.JPG)

## Code:
1. *global variables* 
<br>Please indicate the new GPIO used for the servomotor.
<br>2.*setup()*
<br>Please create the connection between the servomotor and the ESP32.

```
//match between servo motor and the number pin specified 
 servo.attach(PIN_SERVO);
```

3. *loop()* 
<br>Please create a servomotors movement to move the tail of the fish.

```
//Servo movement
for(int i=0;i<3;i=i+1)
{
 //the tail of the fish goes to one side
 servo.write(110); 
 delay(1000); 
 //the tail of the fish goes to other side
 servo.write(60); 
 delay(1000);
}
//the tail of the fish goes to the initial position
servo.write(90);
delay(1000); 
```

<br><img src="../../Image/Warning_sghr.PNG" alt="warning" width="50"/> *If the delay increase, the speed decrease.*

# Task 6: Complete the game 
Finish the game by adding a maximum score function.
 
# Wiring scheme: 
The wiring scheme is the same as the task 5.

## Code:
1. *function*
<br>Please create the max_score() function. This function returns the maximum value of an table. If there is a equality, the winner is set at random. Use this function to determine which player has the highest score.
2. *loop()* 
<br>Please define a table that stores the player's score at the start of the game.

```
// table that stores the player's score
int Table_Score[Number_player];
```

<br>Then, please create a variable *Temporization* that corresponds to the delay time between each instructions given to the servo motor. This time is given by the Score_and_speed() function: the higher the score, the lower the delay and therefore the higher the speed of the fish's tail. 
Thus, for each player, you will have to call the function Score_and_speed() function and then use the variable *Temporization* to give a more or less rapid movement to the fish.

```
int Temporization = Score_and_speed(Score);
```

<br>Once all the players have played. You can display everyone's score, then call the max_score() function and finally display the winner.
<br>For assembly, you can use the following parts to create a support for colored objects:
