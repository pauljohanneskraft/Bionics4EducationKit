![Fish](../../Image/Cycle_of_the_day_photo_finale.JPG)


In this project you will recreate the cycle of the day of the fish. With the fish, we don't talk about sleep, but rather about periods of inactivity when their 
reactivity is reduced. To rest, some species of fish swim more slowly. For this scenario, a light sensor will indicate whether it is day or night. During the day,the fish swims 
fast and during the night, the fish swims slowly. Moreover, unlike humans, fish are unable to manage their inside temperature. The temperature of the aquatic environment in 
which he swims will therefore directly influence his metabolism. Thus, use a temperature sensor to determine if the water is cold or hot , LEDs (blue and red) will light up accordingly.

# TASK 1: Flashing LED 
Create a color sequence with the two LEDs, one LED is built-in the ESP32 and the second is a RGB LED. The RGB LED brings together 3 simple LEDs. Here, please use the blue pin only. To do this, please control the power supply of the LED. The ESP32 only send information to the LED. The LED send no data back to the ESP32.

## Code:

```
//Reading and display the luminosity
int Luminosity_Value = analogRead(PIN_LIGHT_SENSOR); 
Serial.println("Light");
Serial.println(Luminosity_Value,DEC)
```

<br>The value of the variable will be compared to the limit between day and night defined before. If the value is superior than or equal to the limit, you can display " Day" 
,otherwise "Night".

<br>![Cycle of the day step 4](../../Image/Cycle_of_the_day_structure.JPG)

## Code:
1. *global variables* 
<br>Please indicate the numbers of the new GPIO used for the servo motor. 
<br>In addition, please create a global variable that will stock the value of the delay between different motor's instructions. This value determines the speed of the servo 
motor. I'd advise you to put the value of 500 and test several value to undersatand how it works. 
2. *setup()*
<br>First, create the connection for the servo motor:

```
servo.attach(PIN_SERVO);
```

<br>Then,you can initialize the angle of the servomotor:

```
servo.write(90);
```

3. *loop()* 
<br><img src="../../Image/bulb_sghr.PNG" alt="bulb" width="50"/>*Please comment the next code to understand how a servomotor works.* 
<br>Please create a servo motor movement:

```
// SERVO MOVEMENT 
// the servomotor moves to be 110° position
servo.write(110); 
// wait Temporization ms
delay(Temporization); 
// the servomotor moves to be 70° position
servo.write(70);
// wait Temporization ms 
delay(Temporization);
```

<br><img src="../../Image/bulb_sghr.PNG" alt="bulb" width="50"/>*You can modify the swimming amplitude by changing the degree set points and modify the swimming speed by changing the delay (Temporization value), make tests to understand how it works!* 

# Task 5: Final code 
Create the final code. The speed of the fish depends on the luminosity: The fish swim faster by day than by night. The color of the LED depends on the temperature: when it's hot the red LED lights up, the blue one otherwise.
The wiring scheme is the same that task 4.

## Code:
1. *global variables* 
<br>Please create two variables:
* The first is the delay for the speed in day.
* The second is the delay for the speed in night.

```
//Temporization determines the speed of the fish
int Temporization=500; 
//Delay_Day determines the speed for the day
int Delay_Day=500;
//Delay_Nightdetermines the speed for the night  
int Delay_Night = 2000;
```

<br><img src="../../Image/Warning_sghr.PNG" alt="warning" width="50"/> *If the delay increase, the speed decrease.*
<br>3. *loop()* 
<br><img src="../../Image/Warning_sghr.PNG" alt="warning" width="50"/> *Remember to uncomment the task 3 code.*
<br>Please modify the **if structure** to change the color and servo motor's speed wich depends on the quantity of light and the temperature.
* Day: The speed is definied with Delay_Day.
* Night: The speed is definied with Delay_Night. 
<br>The variable *Temporization* is egal to *Delay_Day* or *Delay_Night* depending on the quantity of light.
* Hot: The red LED light up.
* Cold: The blue LED light up.
