<br>![](../../Image/Adaptability_of_the_trunk_photo_final.JPG)

The trunk of elephants is used to breathe, to drink, catch fruit, communicate, etc.. The movements of the trunk are numerous. In this project you will use a light sensor, a touch sensor and a buzzer to create several behaviors depending on the different sensors. You create behaviors like communication, drinking or the sleep.  

## Objective
* You can control an LED with signals.
* You can write if structure.
* You learn how to use a touch sensor.
* You learn how to use a light sensor.
* You leran how to control servomotor.
* You learn to deal with global and local variables.

# Task 1: Snoring with LED
Simulate the snoring of an elephant thanks to a built-in LED. Therefore, please control the power supply of the LED. The ESP32 only send information to the LED. The LED send no data back to the ESP32. 

## Code:
1. Open the *ELEPHANT_Adaptability-of-the-trunk_Code_Challenge.ino*  file.
<br><img src="../../Image/bulb_sghr.PNG" alt="ampoule" width="50"/>*Don't hesitate to consult the documentation to better understand the functions used.*
2.*globales variables*
<br>Please define the "PIN_Built_in" variable with the GPIO's number associed to the LED, GPIO 13.
3. *setup()*
<br>Please indicate the GPIO mode. Then you may notice instructions regarding the serial link. Do not hesitate to open the serial monitor.
4. *loop()*
<br>Please, complete the code to turn on and turn off the led. For structures allow you to create snoring.

# Task 2: Make noise with the passive buzzer
Use the passive buzzer and create a noise using a for loop to control the buzzer. 
<br>The passive buzzer has 3 pins: ground (GND), power supply (VCC) and data pin connection (I/O).

}
```

# Task 3: Create the communication with the touch sensor
Use a touch sensor to comunicate with the elephant: If a contact is detected there is a noise. It may sound like morse language.
<br>The touch sensor has 3 pins: ground (GND), power supply (VCC) and data pin connection (I/O). It sends a high level when a touch is detected.

int State_Touch = digitalRead(PIN_TOUCH);
Serial.printn("State touch");
Serial.println(State_Touch);
```

<br>Please write the code to make a noise each time a contact is detected.

# Task 4: Definition of different time of day with the light sensor
Use the light sensor and definie a different time of the day to create several situations.
<br> The light sensor has 3 pins: ground (GND), power supply (VCC) and data pin connection (OUT). The luminosity sensor sends an analog value to its OUT pin. The abalog value is proportional to the amount of light.
